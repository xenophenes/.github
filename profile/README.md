# pgEdge

**Write anywhere. Read anywhere.** pgEdge is 100% open-source Distributed Postgres, under the PostgreSQL License, for Agentic AI app development and applications that need reliable multi-region high availability while still running 100% community Postgres.

We're a team of PostgreSQL contributors, committers, and longtime community members who came here because distributed Postgres is genuinely interesting. Our CTO [Dave Page](https://github.com/dpage) is a PostgreSQL core team member and the creator of pgAdmin - he'll tell you distributed databases were the subject of his master's dissertation, and he's not joking. In September 2025 we re-licensed our core extensions - Spock, Snowflake, and lolor - from a proprietary license to the PostgreSQL License, because open source isn't a strategy for us. It's just how we think Postgres should work.

Everything here is 100% open-source. No catch.

**[Get started →](https://www.pgedge.com/get-started)** - instant access to all pgEdge products across VM, bare metal, Kubernetes, Docker, and fully managed cloud. Pick your deployment, get your code.
